### Glycogen Storage Diseases
- **Type II Glycogenesis: Pompe's Disease**:
	- Deficiency in ==lysosomal-1,4-glucosidase==.
	- Accumulation of ==undigested glycogen== in lysosomes.
	- The most affected organ, the ==heart==, is enlarged.
	- Infants usually die of heart failure before reaching 2 years old.
	- Among adults, respiratory failure may cause death.
- **Type III: Cori's Disease/Forbes Disease**:
	- Deficiency in ==debranching enzyme==.
- **Type IV: Andersen's Disease**:
	- Deficiency in ==branching enzyme==
	- Abnormal ==glycogen== (insoluble and accumulates in cell) causes organ damage.
	- Life span of usually 12 months to 5 years, due to liver failure.
- **Type V Glycogenesis: McArdle's Disease (myopathic GSD)**:
	- Deficiency in ==glycogen phosphorylase==, primarily in ==muscle tissues==.
	- Persistent ==muscular== weakness, pain, and cramps.
	- Patients excrete ==burgundy-colored== urine after exercise
		- Due to presence of ==myoglobin== from breakdown of muscles.
	- Treatment involves avoiding ==exercise== and ==high-protein== diet.
- **Type VI: Hers' Disease**:
	- Deficiency of ==glycogen phosphorylase== in liver.
	- Symptoms include ==enlarged liver==, hypo==glycemia==, and mild ==retarded== growth.
	- Relatively mild
- **Type VII: Tarui's Disease**:
	- Deficiency in ==phosphofructokinase== in muscles.
	- Abnormally high levels in ==glycogen==.
- **Type VIII and XI: Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome**:
	- Abnormal ==liver phosphorylase== activating-deactivating cascade.
	- Symptoms similar to GSD VI.
- **Type IX**:
	- Deficiency in ==phosphorylase kinase==.
	- Symptoms: muscle pain, pain and cramps.
- **Type X**:
	- Abnormal ==cAMP-dependent kinase== enzyme.
