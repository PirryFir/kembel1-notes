### Myocardial Infarction
- **Description**: 
	- Heart attack, muscle cells of heart dies or is permanently damaged due to ==lack of supply of oxygen and other nutrients==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Following enzymes become elevated following heart attack:
		- ==LDH, H$_4$, and MH$_3$.==
		- ==Creatine kinase, CK (MB isozyme)==
		- ==Troponin==.
- **Disease Risk Factors**:
	- ==Age==
	- ==Obesity==
	- High ==LDL==
	- Low ==HDL==
	- Poorly controlled ==hypertension==.
	- Hyper==cholesterolemia==
	- Hyper==lipidemia==
	- Family history
	- Sedentary lifestyle
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Cardiac cells have insufficient ==energy stores== and depend upon blood flow to bring ==fuel and oxygen==.
- **Treatment**:
	- ==Nitroglycerin/vasodilaters==: open up blood vessels and allow blood flow.
	- ==Thrombolytic therapy==: streptokinase and plasminogen activator.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Restricted blood flow leads to insufficient amount of ==ATP==.
	- ==$\ce{Na+ - K+}$ ATPase== is inhibited, cells attract water and swell up.
