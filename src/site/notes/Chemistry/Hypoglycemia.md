### Hypoglycemia
- **Description**: 
	- ==Low blood glucose level==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Normal range of glucose after 12 hours of fasting is ==70 to 120 mg/dL==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- ==Hunger==.
	- ==Nervousness/tremors/palpitations/perspiration/confusion==, due to release of adrenaline.
	- ==Dizziness/headache/nausea==, caused by shortage of supply of glucose to brain.
	- ==Weakness, loss of consciousness/seizure==, also caused by shortage of glucose to brain.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- ==Fasting or increase activity/exercise==.
	- Excessive ==alcohol== intake.
	- Carbohydrate metabolic ==enzyme deficiency==.
	- Medications that lower ==glucose==.
	- Shortages of ==cortisol, glucagon, or epinephrine== hormones.
	- Hyper==insulinism==
- **Treatment**: 
	- Varies depending on the cause of hypoglycemia.
