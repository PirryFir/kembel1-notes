# Vitamin C
---

The active form of vitamin C is *L-ascorbic acid*, its enantiomer D-ascorbic acid has no pharmacological activity. It is a reducing agent and antioxidant, as well as a cofactor of *hydroxylases*.

Humans and primates cannot synthesize vitamin C, however some organisms can synthesize it from D-glucose. It is metabolized mainly in the liver cells, and also the kidney, the final products include
- Oxalic acid
- Threonic acid
- Xylonic acid
- Lyxonic acid

all of which are excreted out via urine.

Deficiency of vitamin C leads to [[Chemistry/scurvy\|scurvy]], as well as [[anemia\|anemia]] because of inability of iron to incorporate into hemoglobin.

## Functions of Vitamin C
1) Keeps dietary iron in $\ce{Fe^2+}$ state.
2) [[Carnitine\|Carnitine]] synthesis.
3) Protects folic acid redustase.
4) Role in drug metabolism and detoxifying.
5) Regulars cellular humoral immune function: optimum WBC activity.
6) Excretion of [[cholesterol\|cholesterol]].
7) Involve in [[amino acid metabolism\|amino acid metabolism]] of phenylalanine and tyrosine.
8) Cofactor in synthesis of: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
9) Coenzyme of dopamin $\beta$-oxidase.

**Daily recommend intake**: ==60 to 90 mg==
**Upper limit**: ==2000 mg==
Exceeding the limit may cause 
- ==Nausea==
