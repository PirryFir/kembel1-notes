### Phenylketonuria
- **Description**: 
	- ==Autosomal recessive== disorder in amino acid metabolism.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Urinalysis
- **Symptoms**: 
	- Inhibition of ==brain== development, extent of pigmentation may decrease.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Inability to convert ==phenylalanine to tyrosine==, deficiency in ==phenylalanine hydroxylase==.
	- Phenylalanine accumulates and is converted to ==phenylpyruvate==, leading to seizures, brain damage, inhibition of development, mental retardation, organ damage.
	- Tyrosine synthesis is inhibited: decrease in synthesis of ==neurotransmitters==.
	- Decrease in extent of pigmentation as phenylalanine is precursor to ==melanin==.
- **Treatment**:
	- Low ==phenylalanine== diet.
- **Note/Effects**:
