### Type 1a Glycogenesis: Von Gierke's disease
- **Description**: 
	- ==Autosomal recessive== glycogen storage disease affecting liver and kidney
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- ==Liver biopsy== to determine extensive deposition of glycogen.
- **Symptoms (manifested at birth)**: 
	- ==Hepatomegaly==, enlarged liver.
	- ==Adiposity== and ==xanthomas==, fatty deposits under skin.
	- Flabby and poorly developed ==muscles==.
	- ==Hyperlipidemia==, due to excess acetyl CoA.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Deficiency in ==G6P==.
	- High concentrations of ==glycogen and G6P== in cell, creating osmotic pressure gradient.
- **Treatment**:
	- Small ==CHO-rich== diet.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Type 1b, 1c, 1d glycogenesis involve deficiency of ==G6P translocase==.
