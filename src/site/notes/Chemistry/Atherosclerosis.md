### Atherosclerosis
- **Description**: 
	- Hardening of arteries due to ==cholesterol esters==.
	- Narrowing of arteries due to buildup of ==plaque==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Arterial biopsy
	- X-ray
- **Disease Risk Factors**: 
	- [[Chemistry/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes]]
	- [[Chemistry/Obesity\|Obesity]]
	- High blood cholesterol
	- High fat diet
	- Family history
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Macrophages take in oxidized ==LDL==, to become foam, injuring the ==endothelial lining==.
	- ==Platelets== aggregate to site of injury.
	- ==Collagen== is deposited to form ==fibrous plaque==.
	- ==Calcium salts== deposit, clots can form around plaque.
- **Treatment**:
	- Diet and exercise, medications, ==surgically removing== deposits, ==by-pass== surgery, ==angioplasty==.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Insufficient blood flow to limbs.
	- Heart attack
	- Stroke
	- Impairs movement of limbs
	- ==Chest== pain
