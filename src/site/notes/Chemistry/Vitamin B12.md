# Vitamin B12
---
Found in other forms such as hydroxycobalamin, chlorocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin; it is synthesized by microorganisms. Sources of vitamin B12 include: dairy products, meat or seafood, it is, however, not found in plants (unless fortified). The recommended **daily intake** is about ==3 $\mu$g/day==.

A deficiency in vitamin B12 results in [[Chemistry/pernicious anemia\|pernicious anemia]], a strict vegetarian may develop this disease after ~20 to 30 years.
