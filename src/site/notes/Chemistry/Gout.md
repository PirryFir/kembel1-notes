### Gout
- **Description**: 
	- Form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurring red, tender, swollen joint.
	- Associated with high dietary intake of ==purine rich== food, medications, [[Chemistry/Alcoholism\|alcoholism]], [[Chemistry/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]], [[Chemistry/Obesity\|obesity]], kidney disease, and sickle cell disease.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- ==Hyperuricemia==, elevated blood level of ==uric acid==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- Tender, swollen joint on toe or hand.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Limited ==solubility== and excess amounts of uric acid lead to its ==crystallization==.
		- These are recognized by the immune system as foreign substances, causing deposition of ==hydrolytic enzymes== in extremities causing inflammation and pain.
	- Kidney problems: impaired ability to excrete uric acid.
	- Increased ==lactate==, it competes with uric acid for elimination.
- **Treatment**:
	- ==Allopurinol==, inhibits oxidation of ==xanthine (via xanthine oxidase)== to uric acid.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Big toe, pain, swelling, inflammation, redness, stiffness.
	- Uric acid converts to urate through keto-enol tautomerization, can bind with calcium becoming insoluble.
