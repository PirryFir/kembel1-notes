# Diabetes
There are multiple types of diabetes, but they can be put into the main categories *Type 1* and *Type 2*.

>[!column] Types of Diabetes
>>[!Info] Type 1 Diabetes
>Occurs in young patients (juvenile-onset), it is an *insulin-dependent* variant of diabetes, resulting in the ==auto-immune destruction of beta-cells== in the pancreas. 
>
>>[!Info] Type 2 Diabetes
>It is a *non-insulin-dependent* variation of diabetes in which ==insulin resistance increases or insulin production decreases==. Often associated with old age (adult-onset), as well ==obesity, family history, lifestyle, and race==.

## Diagnosis of Diabetes
### Glucose Tolerance Test

One of the ways to determine for diabetes is through the *glucose tolerance test* or *glucose random test*, involves the ingestion of a glucose solution followed by continuous monitoring for 3 hours. In normal subjects, the glucose level would hit a peak at around ==150 mg/dL==, and then gradual return to normal values within 3 hours, this follows from adequate metabolism of glucose within the body. Diabetic subjects incapable of absorbing glucose from blood into metabolizing cells will show that blood glucose levels reaches a higher and remains high for longer periods.

### Glucose Monitoring Diabetes
An automated device for measuring glucose, these rely on the oxidation of glucose to ==gluconic acid==, resulting in a color formation in the device. This is directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample. Typically contains a strip which receives blood from the person and is inserted into the device.
- **Normal**: ==60 to 140== mg/dL
- **Diabetic**: ==200== mg/dL

### Urinalysis
Another way to determine diabetes is through *urinalysis*, excess glucose is excreted into the urine, known as ==glycosuria==. Normally urine does not contain glucose as the kidneys are able to reabsorb all ultrafiltered glucose back into the bloodstream.

### Hb1AC
Most reliable way of measuring glucose blood levels for diabetes, it measures the amount of ==glycosylated Hb==, taking the average of glucose levels over the course of three months.
- **Normal**: ==4% to 5.9==%
- **Diabetic**: above ==7==%

## Role of Insulin
>[!infobox|bg-gray wsmall]
>![Pasted image 20241024162436.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241024162436.png) Structure of insulin

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin, while type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. The *GLUT4* channel protein and glucose transporter, it facilitates the movement of glucose from the blood into the cells. In addition to cell starvation, unabsorbed glucose in the bloodstream is capable of reacting and affecting other biomolecules due t in the bloodstream due to their reactive aldehyde group. 

Insulin activates the GLUT4 protein, in type 1, it is absent altogether and so no receptor-ligand complex can form. In type 2 diabetes, due to old age or other disorders (such as obesity), the receptors are less sensitive, reducing its responsiveness to insulin. In both cases, insulin is manually given to the patient.

## Symptoms of Diabetes
1) ==Weakness/weight loss==
	- Plenty of glucose but the cells are starved.
2) ==Thirst/polyuria==
	- High glucose levels in bloodstream forces the kidneys to excrete the excess together with the fluids in tissue.

3) ==Cataracts==
	- Glucose is reduced by ==aldose reductase== to ==sorbitol==, resulting in the accumulation in the ==lens fiber cells==, increasing pressure and eventually leading to cell ruptures.
	- Inhibitors to the enzyme can be used as treatments, such as ==tolrestat and enalrestat==.

4) ==Slow wound healing==
	- Wound healing requires synthesis of new collagen.
	- Collagen becomes ==glycosylated==, rendering it non-functional. 
5) ==Ketoacidosis==
	- Elevated levels of ==ketone bodies==. When cells have insufficient glucose, alternative sources of fuels are used for metabolism. 
	- This can lower the pH of the blood.
6) ==Organ failure==
	- Progressive and arises from long untreated diabetes. 
	- Glucose left in the blood for too long can lead to the accumulation of ==advanced glycation end products (AGEs)==.
		- Sugars can react nonenzymatically with proteins, e.g. collagen.
		- Carbonyl groups form ==Schiff base linkages== with ==lysine== side chains of proteins.

## Treatment/Management of Diabetes
Best way is through maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, others include regular insulin doses and oral medication
- ==Metformin== improves ==insulin sensitivity== by stimulating glucose uptake via transporters.
- ==3-mercaptopicolinate== and ==hydrazine== inhibit ==PEP carboxykinase==.
- ==Chlorogenic acid== inhibits transport activity by ==G6P== system.
