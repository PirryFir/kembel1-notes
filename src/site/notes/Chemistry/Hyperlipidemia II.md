### Hyperlipidemia II
- **Description**: 
	- Also known as ==familial hypercholesterolemia==, ==hyperproteinemia==, ==hypercholesterolemic xanthomatosis==.
	- Elevated levels of ==cholesterol==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Same as [[Chemistry/Hyperlipidemia I\|Hyperlipidemia I]]
- **Disease Risk Factors**: 
	- Same as hyperlipidemia I.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- ==LDL== transports cholesterol along bloodstream.
		- Can go into liver cell where it is possible to metabolize into bile salts.
		- Or other cells unwantedly, where it is transported to liver by ==HDL==.
	- Deficiency or abnormalities in ==LDL receptor==, causing it to deposit in ==lining of arteries==.
- **Treatment**:
	- Prescription drugs such as ==lovastatin and mevastatin==, which inhibit ==HMG-CoA reductase==.
	- ==Cholestyramine and colestipol==, cationic resins which block ==reabsorption of bile acids== in GI tract.
	- ==Gemfibrozil==, decreases ==VLDL== products (can become LDL).
	- ==Probucol==, increases ==LDL uptake== via nonreceptor-mediated pathways.
	- ==Fiber== rich foods.
	- Alternative medicine.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Cholesterol which has high molecular weight and is non-polar.
	- Can form ==xanthomas==.
	- Increases risk of ==heart diseases and atherosclerosis==.
