# Body Mass Index
Scale that correlates with body fat, taking into considering height - athletes and fit individuals may qualify as *overweight* but not necessarily *over fat*, regardless of their BMI.

According to studies, adults with a BMI of over 25 have an increase chance of premature death and disability. Having a BMI of over 30 is considered [[Chemistry/Obesity\|obesity]].

| BMI        |                           | Risks/Complications                                                                                                                               |

## Overweight
A condition in which body weight is excessively greater than standard body weight. The standard body weight (or ideal body weight) can be estimated by taking away 100cm (or 110cm for those greater than 160cm) from the height to get their weight in kg. 

### Factors Affecting Body Weight
- ==Genetic makeup==; up to 70%.
- ==Programmed fat cells==.
- ==Homeostatic molecules== such as hormones
- Other factors like ==environment, stress, social, cultural and psychological==.
<!--ID: 1729675532304-->


## Calories
- **Gross energy** - oxidization of both digestible and indigestible components using a bomb calorimeter.
- Chemical energy liberated through oxidation (in animal cells) are released as ==60% heat== and ==35-40% ATP==.
- CHO and fats are fully oxidized, their physical = physiological heat values.
- Proteins usually have ==5.6 Kcal/g== (physical heat value), and ==4.6 Kcal/g== (physiological heat value). 
<!--ID: 1729675532310-->


The **metabolic rate** refers to energy metabolism per unit time, when taking it during a relaxed, resting, or postabsorptive subject in a thermally neutral environment, it is known as the **basal metabolic rate** (BMR).

### Factors Affecting BMR
- Gender: higher in ==men==.
- Genes.
- Age: ==younger== usually has higher BMR.
- Height: ==tall and thin== usually have higher BMR.
- Growth: ==children and pregnant women== usually have higher BMR.
- Fever: ==raises== BMR.
- Stress: ==raises== BMR.
- Hormones.
- Physical exercise increases BMR.
- Body fat percentage: ==lower== %BF, higher BMR.
