A steroid hormone and prohormone, precursor to other hormones. It possesses other forms which are
- Vitamin D1 (contains lumisterol and vitamin D2)
- Vitamin D2 (calciferol, ergocalciferol)
- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, activated 7-dehydrocholesterol)
- Vitamin D4 (22:23-dihydroergocalciferol)
- Calcitriol (1,25-dihydrocholecalciferol) [*Active form*]

It is technically not a true vitamin, as adequate exposure to sunlight does not require dietary supplementation. This is because *Vitamin D3* is generated in the skin of animals upon absorption of light energy. The recommended **daily intake** is 15 mg/day. Natural sources of vitamin D include saltwater fish, red meat, and egg yolk.

## Functions of Vitamin D
It plays a role in regulating calcium and phosphorus levels, primary components in bone, and mineralization. A deficiency in vitamin D leads to [[Chemistry/rickets and osteomalacia\|rickets and osteomalacia]] (deficiency in both calcium and vitamin D) in children and adults respectively.

## Vitamin D Toxicity
Sun exposure and diet are unlikely to cause vitamin D toxicity, it is usually caused by overdose in vitamin D supplements. Effects include:
1) Excessive absorption of ==calcium== from intestine.
2) Resorption of ==calcium from bone==.
3) Deposition of calcium and phosphorus in ==soft tissues==.
4) Damage to ==heart, blood vessels, and kidneys==.
5) Calcification of ==renal arteries==.
6) Calcium deposition in ==lungs, tendons, and ligaments==.

Treatment of vitamin D toxicity requires ==discontinuance of supplements, low-calcium diet, and corticosteroid.==
