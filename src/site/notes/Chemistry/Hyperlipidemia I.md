### Hyperlipidemia I
- **Description**: 
	- Elevated levels of ==triacylglycerides==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Physical examination, ==xanthomas or fat deposits== on skin.
	- Laboratory analysis, ==fasting lipid or lipoprotein== test.
	- Total ==cholesterol== + ==LDL== + ==HDL== + ==triglycerides==.
- **Disease Risk Factors**: 
	- ==Family history==
	- ==Obesity==
	- ==Diabetes mellitus==
	- Birth control pills; hormones like ==estrogen== and ==corticosteroids==.
	- Certain ==diuretics==, and ==beta-blockers==.
	- Dietary fat intake per total calories greater than ==40%==.
	- Saturated fat intake per total calories greater than ==10%==.
	- Cholesterol intake greater than ==300 mg== per day.
	- ==Alcohol== and ==cigarette smoking==.

	- Deficiency in ==lipoprotein lipase==
- **Treatment**:
	- ==Diet, exercise==, and medication.
- **Note/Effects**:

	- Triglycerides cannot ==hydrolyze and be absorbed into cell==.
	- Accumulation in blood.
