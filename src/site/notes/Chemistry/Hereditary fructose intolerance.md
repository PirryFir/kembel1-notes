### Hereditary Fructose Intolerance
- **Description**: 
	- Also called ==fructosoria==; ==fructosemia==; ==fructose aldolase B deficiency==.
	- An ==autosomal recessive== disorder of fructose metabolism.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- ==Total reducing sugar + glucose + inorganic phosphate in plasma==.
	- Measurement of ==enzyme activity==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- Intolerance to ==fruits and sucrose-containing foods==.
	- ==Abdominal pain/vomiting== following ingestion of fructose.
	- ==Sucrose== acidosis.
	- [[Chemistry/Hypoglycemia\|Hypoglycemia]].
	- ==Jaundice/liver failure==.
	- Poor feeding, irritability among ==infants==.
	- ==Convulsions/seizures==
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Defective ==fructose enzyme== due to genetic mutation.
	- Either ==fructokinase== in liver, ==aldolase A== in peripheral tissues, or ==aldolase B== in liver.
	- High total reducing sugar due to fructose in blood.
- **Treatment**:
	- Exclusion of ==fructose/sucrose== in diet.
- **Note/Effects**: 
	- Effects include 
		- Accumulation of ==fructose-1-phosphate==, which inhibits condensation of ==G3P and DHAP== to ==F1,6BP==.
			- This depletes supply of ==ATP==, inhibiting ==gluconeogenesis== in liver and kidney.
		- ==P$_i$== depletion in cell as it is trapped in ==F1P==, inhibiting glycogenolysis.
		- No ==gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis==
		- ==Hypoglycemia==
		- ==Acid==osis
		- ==Hepatic== or ==renal== failure.
		- Death
