### Mannosidosis
- **Description**: 
	- Rare, hereditary, lysosomal storage disorder.
	- Abnormal shape of ==nerve cells in gray matter and cerebellum==.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- Measure of ==enzyme activity==.
	- Presence of undigested material in ==white blood cell==.
	- Increase in size of ==lysosomes== and presence of huge ==vacuoles==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- ==Liver and spleen== enlargement.
	- ==Skeletal== abnormalities.
	- ==Mental retardation==.
	- Course facial features, prominent forehead, flattened nasal bridge, small nose, broad mouth
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Deficiency in lysosomal ==$\alpha$-D-mannosidase==.
	- It is involved in the breakdown of ==N-linked glycoproteins== through sequential degradation of ==high-mannose and complex oligosaccharides==.
	- Therefore ==mannose-rich glycoproteins== accumulate in cells.
- **Treatment**:
	- ==Enzyme== replacement.
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Can lead to ==cerebral dysfunction== leading to ==dementia, hearing loss, impaired speech ability, corneal clouding==.
	- Hydrocephalus
	- Recurrent ==infections==.
	- ==Skeletal== malformation.
	- ==Muscular pain==.
