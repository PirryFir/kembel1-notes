### Lactose Intolerance
- **Description**: 
	- Inability to digest lactose.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- ==Stool acidity==. 
	- ==H2== breath.
	- ==Biopsy==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- ==Nausea== 
	- ==Cramps==
	- ==Diarrhea==
	- ==Bloating==
	- ==Flatulence==.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Deficiency in ==enzyme lactase== in the small intestines (primary deficiency). Secondary deficiency is deterioration of the mucous membrane of the small intestine due to gastro-intestinal ==infection or allergy to cowâ€™s milk==. Undigested lactose in intestines is broken down by ==bacteria== causing symptoms. Osmotic load of the unabsorbed nutrient causes the ==secretion of fluids and electrolytes== in fecal water and intestinal transit.
- **Treatment**:
	- Elimination of ==dairy products== in diet, and addition of ==lactase== through food products.
- **Note**: 
	- Lactase is usually found in the brush border of the small intestines of humans. Free lactose is fermented by bacteria in colon, yielding short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen gas.
