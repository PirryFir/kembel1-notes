# Alcoholism
---

Ethanol is the primary constituent of alcoholic drinks, it is small enough to pass through membranes via diffusion. 20% is absorbed in the stomach, while the rest in the small intestine. Being polar it is also readily distributed in the bloodstream.

The rate at which ethanol is absorbed is dependent on
1) Food and exercise, resulting in ==slow== absorption.
2) Rate at which it is consumed, at a lower rate it will be broken down in the ==liver== with no significant impact on other parts of the body.

## Ethanol Metabolism
10% of ethanol is eliminated in urine, sweat, breath; while the rest is broken down in the liver. The primary pathway for the breakdown of ethanol is #flashcard 
- $\text{Ethanol} \; + \ce{NAD+-> CH_{3}CHO + NADH + H+}$ *(cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase)*
- $\ce{CH_{3}CHO + NAD+ + H_{2}O -> CH_{3}COO- + NADH + H+}$ *(mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase)*
- $\ce{CH_{3}COO- + CoASH + ATP -> AcetylCoA + AMP + PP_{i}}$ *(thiokinase)*

Ethanol consumption may lead to [[Chemistry/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]], and NADH may inhibit [[Chemistry/KEMBIO2/Gluconeogenesis\|gluconeogenesis]]. 
$$
\ce{Lactate + NAD+ <=> Pyruvate + NADH}
$$
Lactate competes with uric acid for elimination, increase in lactate causes [uric acid] to rise. 

At higher ethanol concentrations, another pathway is activated: the ==microsome ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)==, consisting of ethanol inducible ==P450 isozyme== and NADPH cytochrome ==P450 reductase==

MEOS pathway #flashcard 
$$
\ce{Ethanol + NADPH + H+ + O_{2} -> Acetaldehyde + NADP+ + 2H_{2}O}
$$

The third pathway for ethanol metabolism is located in the ==peroxisomes== through the action of ==catalase==, an important antioxidant enzyme as it normally catalyzes the removal of ==$\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$.==

## Drug Interactions of Ethanol
Alcohol should not be taken together with ==acetaminophen, anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and antihistamines== as the catabolic products of these drugs in the microsomal pathway could lead to some toxic interactions with alcohol. The combination of ==barbiturates== (depressant drugs) and alcohol can be dangerous as they both activate inhibitory pathways through ==GABA-activated channels==. It may prolong depression of CNS and lead to ==paralysis==.
