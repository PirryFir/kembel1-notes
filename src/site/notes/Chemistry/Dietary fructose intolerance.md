### Dietary Fructose Intolerance
- **Description**: 
	- Inability to absorb fructose efficiently.
- **Diagnosis**: 
	- ==Glucose breath==.
	- ==Lactose breath==.
	- ==Fructose breath==.
- **Symptoms**: 
	- ==Bloating/abdominal pain/diarrhea==.
- **Biochemical basis**: 
	- Abnormalities in fructose ==transporter in intestine==.
	- Presence of ==bacteria== inhibiting fructose transporter.
	- ==Chemotherapy/radiation==.
	- Injury to ==intestinal lining==.
	- ==Motility== problems.
- **Treatment**:
	- ==Antibacterial agents== (if caused by bacterial infection)
	- Exclusion of ==fructose/sucrose== from diet
- **Note/Effects**:
	- Problem lies within digestive system and is localized within small intestine, bearing similar symptoms to [[Chemistry/Lactose intolerance\|lactose intolerance]]
